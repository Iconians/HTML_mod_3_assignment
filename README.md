Create a fully functional registration form that demonstrates your understanding of forms, inputs, and validation. Your form should include:

**Requirements:**
1. Proper form structure with `action` and `method` attributes
2. At least 8 different input types (text, email, password, number, date, tel, url, checkbox, radio, select)
3. All inputs must have associated labels using the `for` attribute
4. Group related fields using `<fieldset>` and `<legend>`
5. Add `required` attributes to essential fields
6. Use `placeholder` text for guidance
7. Include validation attributes (`minlength`, `maxlength`, `pattern` where appropriate)
8. Add a submit button and a reset button
9. Ensure the form is accessible (keyboard navigable, proper labels)
10. Use semantic HTML throughout

**Submission:**
Submit your HTML file with the complete form. The form should validate properly in the browser, and all code should follow HTML best practices.
