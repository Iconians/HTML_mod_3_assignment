Create a fully functional registration form that demonstrates what you learned in Module 3 (Lessons 3.1–3.8). Your form should include:

**Requirements**

- **Form structure** — Use a `<form>` with appropriate `action` and `method` attributes (use POST for a registration form).
- **At least 6 different field types** from this module: text, email, password, number, textarea, select (dropdown), checkbox, and/or radio. For example: name (text), email (email), password (password), age or zip (number), a short bio (textarea), country or role (select), “Subscribe to newsletter” (checkbox), and “How did you hear about us?” (radio group).
- **Labels** — Every input, textarea, and select must have an associated label using the `for` attribute (matching the control’s `id`).
- **Grouping** — Group related fields with `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` (e.g. “Contact Information,” “Account Details,” “Preferences”).
- **Required fields** — Add the `required` attribute to essential fields (e.g. name, email, password).
- **Placeholders** — Use `placeholder` on at least two text-style inputs for guidance. Keep visible labels; placeholder is a hint only.
- **Length limits** — Use `minlength` and/or `maxlength` on at least one text or textarea field.
- **Buttons** — Include a submit button and a reset button, each with an explicit `type` (`type="submit"` and `type="reset"`).
- **Accessibility** — Ensure the form is keyboard navigable and that every control has a proper label (no unlabeled inputs).
- **Code quality** — Use clear, consistent indentation and follow the HTML best practices covered in this module.

**Submission**  
Submit your HTML file with the complete form. The form should validate in the browser (e.g. required fields and invalid email are caught), and the code should follow the practices taught in Module 3.

**Grading Criteria**

| Criterion | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Form structure and attributes (action, method, fieldset, legend) | 20% |
| Input/control types and labels (at least 6 types, all with `for`/`id` labels) | 25% |
| Validation (required, placeholder, minlength/maxlength) | 20% |
| Accessibility (labels, grouping, keyboard use) | 15% |
| Code quality and best practices | 20% |
